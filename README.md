## 📌 Repository Overview  
This repository contains all files needed to understand, run, and evaluate the complete emotion recognition pipeline.

### 🔹 Methodology  
The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Tokenization and sequence padding  
- Word embedding generation  
- Deep learning model architecture  
- Training, validation, and testing  
- Predicting emotions on new tweets  

### 🔹 Jupyter Notebook  
The complete implementation is inside:  
- **`tweet-emotion-clean.ipynb`** — contains preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and emotion prediction.

### 🔹 Results  
The model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Training/validation accuracy and loss graphs  
- Sample predictions on real tweets  

### 🔹 Model Files   
- Trained Model (`model.h5` / `model.pth`)  
- Tokenizer (`tokenizer.pkl`)  
- Label Encoder (`label_encoder.pkl`)

## 🧠 Project Summary  
This project applies **modern deep learning techniques** to text-based emotion classification.

### 📚 Techniques Used  
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, punctuation handling)  
- Tokenization & padding  
- Word embeddings (GloVe / Word2Vec / Embedding Layer)  
- Deep learning models:
  - LSTM / BiLSTM  
  - GRU  
  - 1D CNN (optional)  
  - Transformer/BERT (if implemented)

### 🎯 Emotion Categories  
Depending on the dataset, emotions may include:
- Joy  
- Sadness  
- Anger  
- Fear  
- Love  
- Surprise  

### 🏆 Performance Highlights  
(Insert your actual model results)  
- **Accuracy:** XX%  
- **F1-score:** XX%  
- Consistent performance across multiple emotion classes  
- Generalizes well to unseen tweets

## 💡 Purpose & Motivation  
Millions of tweets are posted every day, containing valuable emotional cues. Understanding these emotions can help in:

- Public opinion analysis  
- Mental health trend detection  
- Customer feedback interpretation  
- Improving chatbots and AI assistants  

This project demonstrates how deep learning can be used to create an efficient, scalable emotion detection system.
